  summary: An optimization framework for Optimal Control Programming in biomechanics
  description: |
    `Bioptim` is an optimal control program (OCP) framework for biomechanics.
    It is based on the efficient `biorbd` biomechanics library and befits from 
    the powerful algorithmic diff provided by CasADi. It interfaces the robust Ipopt
    and fast ACADOS solvers to suit all your needs for an OCP in biomechanics.
